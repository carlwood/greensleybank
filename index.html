            <h1>Location</h1>
            <p>Located high within the Yorkshire Dales National Park on the roof of northern England, Adele, my wife, and I live happily.  Mother earth courses naturally through our veins. Living where we do we experience a plethora of flora and fauna which our livestock thrives upon.  Additionally, throughout the year, there is always plenty of differing birdlife to be observed.  For example on occasions during the summer months we can see from our kitchen window Swallows, Sand Martins and House Martins swooping over our pasture fields, whilst above are Swifts, all at the same time. </p></div>

            <div class="homesection">
                <h1>Herdwick Sheep</h1>
                <p>A flock of 50 ewes also run alongside the cattle, all are quiet, bucket reared and respectful of fencing and wall enclosures.</p>
                <p>An ancient breed of sheep developed through many generations, suited to the high hills and mountains. They tend to be long lived, excellent mothers and robust so as to thrive in the type of terrain that delivers plenty of rain and snow. Again, annually we have available for sale both young tups and gimmer lambs/shearlings.</p>

            <div class="rightsection">
                <h1>Quality</h1>
                <p>Occasionally we have for sale both young bulls and heifers.  All cattle are within the Bio-Best health scheme and are one of the very few UK herds currently accredited 'Elite' for all of the four major, common diseases i.e. IBR, Johne's, Lepto and BVD.  There is no need to annually vaccinate our cattle as we are clear of these problems.  We are also located within a 4 year TB test area, never having experienced a positive reading.</p>

                <h1>Beef Shorthorn Cattle</h1>
                <p>As you can glean from the site photographs my Beef Shorthorn cattle work hard within a tough environment, they are ideally suited for a minimal input farming system, indeed they thrive on fresh air and grass whilst producing sublime tasting beef!</p>
                <p>We selected this particular breed of cattle for the following basic reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They are extremely docile, it has been known for me to treat a foot problem by lifting said foot and dealing with the issue without being kicked black and blue. All animals are halter trained, and very friendly.</li>
                    <li>We liked the look of them - have you ever seen such attractive, cracking looking beef cattle?</li>
                    <li>They taste fantastic - <a class="producelink" href="produce">see our produce</a></li>
                    <li>They carry the characteristic of hardiness therefore a lot less work, ours come inside as late as possible, but usually between Christmas and the New Year.</li>
                    <li>Last, but not least they are an historic breed of bovine that originates from our particular locality of the world.</li>
                </ul>

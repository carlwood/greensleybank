            <p>Can be supplied in the form of half, or a full carcass.  A slow growing, lean animal, with a slightly gamey texture.  We only keep this breed as my wife observed a blind tasting and Herdwick came out top from a list of ten other types of sheep for flavour.  All product comes professionally butchered, boxed, labelled and ready for the freezer, or your plate.  Box Wt. around 40 lb. (18 Kg.)  Usually available between January and May.</p>
            <p class="price">&pound;115 full lamb, &pound;70 half.</p>
            <p class="note">Note &mdash; Around the autumn period of each year, occasionally there is Herdwick mutton available.  This is sold again in half, or full carcass weights. Utterly superb tasting produce that time has forgotten.  Enquire for availability.</p>

            <p>I feel fortunate to have found a producer of fine quality beef,lamb and duck. The beef is tender, full of flavour and lean. The lamb is succulent, strong flavour and lean. The duck is a strong flavour and not fatty at all. Paul and Adele were most hospitable when we called to collect some duck, and gave us a tour of the farm. The animals have a good life and are well cared for. Its Yorkshire's best secret. - Mrs. J. Dickson (Blackpool)
            <p>Greensley Bank's meat is among the very best I've ever eaten.  Purchasing direct from the farm is without a doubt the best decision we've made. The difference between this and supermarket fare is night and day. Buying meat of this calibre in bulk presents superb value for money and the flavour is out of this world.  Delivery is straightforward and the meat arrives promptly the next day, perfectly chilled.  We are committed, repeat customers and haven't looked back since our first purchase. - Mrs. C. Cooney (Glasgow)</p>
            <p>Paul produces beef that tastes like beef should, as we remember it from our childhoods.  We have had two deliveries of beef so far and are thoroughly enjoying the cuts and joints; we had a piece of flank, roasted and it melted in our mouths.  Delivery is excellent, it comes very well insulated, and Paul will get it butchered to your requirements.  We are his most southerly customer and apart from the fact that it would be good to visit his farm, it makes no difference that we are so far away, delivery is first class. - Mrs. S. Mace (Brighton)</p>

        <p class="note">Please note -</p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>All produce is reared for taste, not volume, on the green pasture grass of Wensleydale.</li>
            <li>All livestock made available is born/hatched/reared at Greensley Bank, nothing is purchased in.</li>
            <li>All animals are grass fed  i.e. not reared on concentrates to enable them to grow more quickly.  They are ready, when they are ready.</li>
            <li>Our local abattoir is less than one mile from home, we literally arrive five minutes after departing.  Our stock experience no stress as a consequence.</li>
            <li>All produce tastes completely different from that which can be obtained from any supermarket.</li>
            <li>All produce comes fully oven ready.</li>
            <li>Rearing these animals correctly for your plate is only one half of the eating experience. The other half is the cooking, over to you.</li>
            <li>All orders will be delivered to your door.</li>
        </ul>
